# Aussie Add-ons repository for Kodi
THIS IS NEW THING WHICH WE CAN LEARN

http://aussieaddons.com/installation

We're maintaining a repository of Kodi add-ons for Australian content, including all free-to-air Catch-up TV services and others including AFL, NRL and Netball and BigPond Movies.


## Installation
Follow the Aussie Add-ons repository [installation guide](http://aussieaddons.com/installation/) to set
up the Aussie Add-ons repository.

Do **NOT** download the zip file from this GitHub repository or you will receive the error `Installing the Add-on from the zip file located at xxx failed due to an invalid structure.`

Once the repository is installed, you can install the any of our add-ons through the Kodi Add-on manager by accessing the menus:

 * System ->
 * Settings ->
 * Add-ons ->
 * Install from repository ->
 * Aussie Add-ons (or XBMC CatchupTV AU Add-ons) ->
 * Video add-ons ->
 * _your desired add-on_ ->
 * Install


The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager).
